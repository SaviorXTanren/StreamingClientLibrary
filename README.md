# PROJECT HAS BEEN ARCHIVED
The StreamingClientLibrary project has officially been archived and is no longer being actively worked on. Changes are being done in the main project that leverages this library require it to become fully integrated into the larger project as opposed to being maintained separately. This repository will be kept around for archival and research purposes, but no future updates are planned for this. If you wish, you can look at the parent project that leverages this library, which will soon have it's core code moved over to it: [https://github.com/SaviorXTanren/mixer-mixitup](https://github.com/SaviorXTanren/mixer-mixitup)

# StreamingClientLibrary
C# client library for Twitch, YouTube, and other streaming services

## What is this?
When this project was initially created, it was made to fill a gap that existed with lack of a .NET-based library for interaction with Mixer. As time has gone on, the project has added support for additional streaming sites and strives to build a "one-stop shop" to interact with variety of different sites in a consistent manner.

## Requirements
This library uses the native WebSocket support found in Windows 8 & higher. This means that any application that uses this library must be running Windows 8 or higher.

## Current functionality
All of the most common APIs are available across all sites. We've also added support for the various other forms of connections for each site:
- Chat IRC for Twitch, PubSub WebSockets for Twitch
- Automated Chat Web Call for YouTube

## How do I get started using it?
Download the appropriate NuGet package based on the streaming site you want to work with:

Twitch: [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/StreamingClientLibrary.Twitch.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/StreamingClientLibrary.Twitch)

YouTube: [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/StreamingClientLibrary.YouTube.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/StreamingClientLibrary.YouTube)

There are sample apps available in this repository for each of the different streaming sites that you can reference for some of the more common scenarios. Additionally, there are a large series of unit tests that go through all of the individual functionality that you can look at.
